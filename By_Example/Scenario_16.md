# Security Posture by Example

## Scenario 16 - Software provenance and pedigree

Amalgamated Imaging is a subsidiary of
the Amalgamated Example Company
which produces and sells image processing and storage products
to the US National Reconnaissance Office (NRO).

Based on the success of Amalgamated Security
and Amalgamated Capital,
Amalgamated Imaging implements a PACE system
similar to [Scenario 15](./Scenario_15.md).

Because Amalgamated Imaging products are used
for highly classified USG projects,
Amalgamated Imaging adds provenance and pedigree
information in the SBOMs as well as maintains
provenance and pedigree information
about the SBOMs themselves.
