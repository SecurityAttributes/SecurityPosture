# Security Posture by Example

## Scenario 18 - Mergers and Acquisitions Sunny Day

Amalgamated Virtual Sports is a subsidiary of the
Amalgamated Example Company
which produces and sells virtual reality games
based on many professional sports programs.

Amalgamated Virtual Sports has plans to acquire
Augmented Reality Sporting, a start-up selling augmented reality
products based on college sports programs.

The Amalgamated Virtual Sports
CISO recalls having read an article,
["The role of information technology systems in the performance of mergers and acquisitions", Franz T. Lohrke a, Cynthia Frownfelter-Lohrke a, David J. Ketchen, Jr.]](www.sciencedirect.com),
on the increased frequency of data breaches in M&A situations.
His staff also warned that Augmented Reality Sporting,
being a startup, might not have adequate
resources dedicated to security
and there may be latent financial risk
of cyber attack.

The Amalgamated team requests cybersecurity information on
Augmented Reality Sporting's products
and suppliers.

Recognizing the importance of cybersecurity and cyber resilience,
Augmented Reality Sporting has invested in
implementing a PACE system and has the requested
information at their fingertips.
Via API's,
the Augmented Reality Sporting PACE system
loads all the relevant data into the Amalgamated PACE system.
The Amalgamated CISO team performs its due diligence
and concludes there is acceptable risk.
The acquisition proceeds and is a wild success
resulting in million dollar bonus's to all involved.
