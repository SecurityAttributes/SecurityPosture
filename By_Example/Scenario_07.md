# Security Posture by Example

## Scenario 7 - Active Attack, no known material consequences foreseen

One of the corporate subsidiaries of Amalgamated Example Company
is a manufacturer of seat belt webbing for the automotive industry.
The Auto-ISAC delivered STIX objects
very similar to those in previous examples.
In this scenario,
the seat belt subsidiary has a complete and accurate inventory of
its devices and complete SBOMs for all those devices.
Similar to scenario 6, a device was found with a vulnerable component.
[Kestrel](../GLOSSARY.md#kestrel) threat hunting was initiated and
in this scenario, intruders were discovered already in the company's
administrative systems.

The executive dashboard was updated to
"Active Attack, no known material consequences foreseen"
since the attack was caught early on and the threat hunting team
predicts the attackers can be contained before material damage is done.
