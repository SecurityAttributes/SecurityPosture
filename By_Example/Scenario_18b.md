# Security Posture by Example

## Scenario 18 - Mergers and Acquisitions Rainy Day

Due to the huge success in the
[previous scenario](./Scenario_18.md),
Amalgamated Virtual Sports
decides to acquire
Beat the Spread, a sports betting company where
punters bet on the spread on other sports betting sites.

As in the previous example,
the AEC team requests cybersecurity information on
Beat the Spread's
products and suppliers.

Beat the Spread has not invested in cybersecurity
and has neither a PACE system
nor SBOMs for most of it's products.
It does have one single-hop SBOM one developer made
to learn about SBOMs.
Unfortunately that developer parlayed his SBOM expertise
into a better job at another company.

The Amalgamated Virtual Sports CISO team
begins its due diligence by analyzing the one SBOM.
Analysis of the one SBOM reveals both major licensing issues
and many unpatched vulnerabilities, several severe.
Another troubling point is these have had known fixes
for many years.
The team recognizes Beat the Spread is a higher value target
to hackers because of the higher dollar value
due to gambling money changing hands.
The team preforms a quantitative risk analysis
concluding significant probability
of material financial risk.

The CISO team informs the boards of both companies of their findings.
The Amalgamated board stops the proposed acquisition
based on these results.
The Beat the Spread board ignores the recommendations
and goes looking for another buyer.

One of Amalgamated's competitors,
without preforming an equivalent due diligence,
acquires Beat the Spread at what it considers bargain basement prices.
Six months later, the competitor makes adverse headlines due to a
major cyberattack leveraging
Beat the Spread's
unpatched vulnerabilities;
and shortly thereafter declares bankruptcy.
Many of their customers move to Amalgamated resulting in even larger
profits and bonuses.
