# Security Posture by Example

## Scenario 8 - Active Attack with material consequences

One of the corporate subsidiaries of Amalgamated Example Company
is a medical device manufacturer (MDM).
This MDM also received the STIX information from the HS-ISAC
as in earlier examples.
In this scenario,
the MDM has a complete and accurate inventory of
its devices and complete SBOMs for all those devices
stored in their PACE system.
Similar to
[[scenario 6]](../Scenario_06.md), 
a device was found with a vulnerable component.
In this case it was older model infusion pump that is used in many
hospitals world wide.
In most cases, the pump is connected to the hospitals' private networks,
but unfortunately the pump has no software update capability.
Because the techniques described in the STIX object
could result in loss of life, this is seen as a major public
relations issue and a major liability issue for
the MDM.

The executive dashboard was updated to
"Active Attack with material consequences" and
the executive team and board were informed.
