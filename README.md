# Security Posture

The english definition of posture is
"state or condition at a given time
with respect to a capability in particular circumstances".
Posture as used on this website is either the security posture
or the safety posture - i.e.
the classic definition but with respect to either security or safety.
Assessing posture  generally consists of understanding, for a given

the relevant
[attributes ](./GLOSSARY.md#attribute) of that device.
