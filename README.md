# Security Posture

Posture - noun - state or condition at a given time
with respect to a capability in particular circumstances

In the realm of Posture Attribute Collection and Evaluation,
we deal in state or condition at a particular time as it pertains 
to security or safety. 

Assessing posture  generally consists of understanding, for a given
[device](./GLOSSARY.md#device)
(or [system](./GLOSSARY.md#system), or
[system of systems](./GLOSSARY.md#system_of_systems))
the relevant
[attributes ](./GLOSSARY.md#attribute) of that device.

Put simply, when it comes to security posture, we're very interested
in knowing where and how we stand at all times.

## Security Posture by Example
Concepts are one thing, but understanding how they function in real life
is an essential component to their effectiveness.

At [By Example](./By_Example/README.md), you'll find realistic scenarios 
that demonstrate how posture attributes can be used as part of business processes.
